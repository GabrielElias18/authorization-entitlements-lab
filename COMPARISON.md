# Entitlement Server Comparison: SpiceDB vs Neo4j

## Executive Summary

This document compares two entitlement server implementations—SpiceDB (Zanzibar-style) and Neo4j (GraphDB)—for use in microservice architectures, using practical examples of typical financial sector use cases with complex delegation patterns.

## 1. Modeling Complexity

### SpiceDB (Zanzibar-style)
**Strengths:**
- **Declarative Schema**: Clear separation of resources, relations, and permissions
- **Built-in RBAC**: Native support for role-based access control
- **Caveat System**: Rich contextual permissions with time-based and conditional logic
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency guarantees with distributed architecture

**Challenges:**
- **Schema Rigidity**: Changes require careful migration planning
- **Learning Curve**: Zanzibar model concepts (resources, relations, subjects)
- **Limited Flexibility**: Less support for complex property-based queries

**Example Schema (from actual implementation):**
```yaml
definition account {
  relation owner: user
  relation delegated_access: poa
  relation accountant_access: user with within_active_range
  
  permission can_view_transactions = owner + delegated_access->delegate_with_time_and_limit + accountant_access
  permission can_download_statement = owner + delegated_access->delegate_with_time_and_limit + accountant_access
  permission can_initiate_payment = owner + delegated_access->delegate_with_time_and_limit
}

definition poa {
  relation delegate_with_time_and_limit: user with within_time_and_limit
}

caveat within_time_and_limit(amount int, max_amount int, start timestamp, end timestamp, now timestamp) {
  amount <= max_amount && now >= start && now <= end
}
```

### Neo4j (GraphDB)
**Strengths:**
- **Flexible Modeling**: Rich property support on nodes and relationships
- **Visual Querying**: Intuitive graph traversal patterns
- **Dynamic Schema**: Easy to add properties and relationships
- **Complex Queries**: Native support for multi-hop traversals

**Challenges:**
- **Schema Design**: Requires careful graph modeling decisions
- **Query Complexity**: Complex permission checks need sophisticated Cypher queries
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency in distributed setups

**Example Query (from actual implementation):**
```cypher
MATCH (user:User {id: $userId})
MATCH (account:Account {id: $accountId})
WITH user, account
OPTIONAL MATCH (user)-[owns:OWNS]->(account)
WITH user, account, owns IS NOT NULL as direct_owner
OPTIONAL MATCH (user)-[poa:HAS_POA]->(account)
WHERE datetime($testDate) >= datetime(poa.starts_at) 
  AND datetime($testDate) <= datetime(poa.expires_at) 
  AND ($amount <= poa.payment_limit OR poa.payment_limit IS NULL)
WITH user, account, direct_owner, count(poa) as valid_poa
OPTIONAL MATCH (user)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(role:Role)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(org:Org)-[:OWNS]->(account)
WITH user, account, direct_owner, valid_poa, count(role) as role_access
RETURN (direct_owner OR valid_poa > 0 OR role_access > 0) as canPay
```

## 2. Architectural Characteristics

### SpiceDB - External Authorization Engine
**Architecture:**
- **Dedicated system**: Purpose-built for authorization decisions
- **gRPC API**: Binary protocol with strong typing
- **Relationship model**: Tuple-based permission storage

- Separation of authorization logic from application code
- Built-in caveats for complex business rules
- Standardized Zanzibar pattern
- Authorization-specific optimizations

**Considerations:**
- Additional service to deploy and maintain
- Network overhead for permission checks
- Learning curve for Zanzibar concepts

### Neo4j - Database-Embedded Authorization
**Architecture:**
- **Single system**: Authorization logic within database queries
- **Cypher queries**: Graph query language for permissions
- **Property graphs**: Rich relationship and node properties
- **Direct access**: No additional service layer

**Strengths:**
- Visual representation of access patterns
- Familiar database development patterns
- Rich querying capabilities for complex scenarios
- Single system to manage and monitor

**Considerations:**
- Business logic embedded in database queries
- Database performance directly impacts authorization
- Graph modeling complexity for authorization patterns

## 3. API Design for Microservices

### SpiceDB API Design
```typescript
// Simple, declarative API
interface SpiceDBClient {
  checkPermission(request: {
    resource: { objectType: string; objectId: string };
    permission: string;
    subject: { object: { objectType: string; objectId: string } };
    context?: Record<string, any>;
  }): Promise<{ permissionship: number }>;
}

// Usage in microservice
const hasPermission = await spicedbClient.checkPermission({
  resource: { objectType: "account", objectId: "acc123" },
  permission: "can_download_statement",
  subject: { object: { objectType: "user", objectId: "charlie" } },
  context: { now: new Date().toISOString() }
});
```

**Advantages:**
- **Simple Interface**: Single method for all permission checks
- **Declarative**: Clear intent, no query construction
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with generated clients
- **Caching**: Built-in result caching

### Neo4j API Design
```typescript
// Flexible, query-based API
interface Neo4jClient {
  runQuery(query: string, parameters: Record<string, any>): Promise<QueryResult>;
  checkPermission(userId: string, resourceId: string, permission: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Usage in microservice
const hasPermission = await neo4jClient.checkPermission(
  "charlie", 
  "acc123", 
  "can_download_statement"
);
```

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility**: Custom queries for complex scenarios
- **Rich Data**: Access to full graph context
- **Analytics**: Support for complex aggregations
- **Real-time**: Direct access to graph structure

## 4. Developer Experience: Adding New Permissions

### Adding Simple Permission: "can_transfer_funds"

**SpiceDB Approach:**
```yaml
# Update model.zaml schema
definition account {
  relation delegate: user with transfer_limit
  permission can_transfer_funds = owner + delegate
}

caveat transfer_limit(amount int, max_amount int) {
  amount <= max_amount
}
```

**Neo4j Approach:**
```cypher
// Add relationship and query function
MATCH (user:User)-[rel:CAN_TRANSFER]->(account:Account)
WHERE $amount <= rel.max_amount
RETURN count(rel) > 0 as canTransfer
```

### Developer Experience Comparison

| **Factor** | **SpiceDB** | **Neo4j** | **Winner** |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Learning Curve** | Zanzibar concepts + caveats | Cypher + graph thinking | **Neo4j** |
| **Adding Simple Permissions** | Schema + tuple load | Single Cypher query | **Neo4j** |
| **Complex Business Logic** | Caveat expressions | Embedded query logic | **SpiceDB** |
| **Performance Optimization** | Relationship modeling | Index tuning + query optimization | **SpiceDB** |
| **Error Handling** | Authorization-specific errors | Database + application errors | **SpiceDB** |

## 5. Functional Parity Validation

Both implementations were tested with **18 identical scenarios** covering:
- **Emma's POA**: Time + payment limit restrictions (5 test cases)
- **Adi's Accountant Access**: Time-bound view/download permissions (6 test cases)  
- **POA Delegated Access**: Cross-account permissions via delegation (3 test cases)
- **Direct & Role-based**: Owner and organizational permissions (4 test cases)

**Result**: **100% functional parity** - both systems produced identical authorization decisions for all test scenarios.

## 6. Microservice Integration Patterns

### SpiceDB Integration
```typescript
// Middleware pattern
class SpiceDBMiddleware {
  constructor(private client: SpiceDBClient) {}
  
  async checkAccess(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const { userId, resourceId, permission } = req.body;
    
    try {
      const result = await this.client.checkPermission({
        resource: { objectType: "account", objectId: resourceId },
        permission,
        subject: { object: { objectType: "user", objectId: userId } }
      });
      
      if (result.permissionship === 2) { // HAS_PERMISSION
        next();
      } else {
        res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied" });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: "Permission check failed" });
    }
  }
}
```

### Neo4j Integration
```typescript
// Service pattern
class Neo4jEntitlementService {
  constructor(private client: Neo4jClient) {}
  
  async checkAccess(userId: string, resourceId: string, permission: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const query = `
      MATCH (user:User {id: $userId})
      MATCH (resource:Account {id: $resourceId})
      // Complex permission logic here
      RETURN count(*) > 0 as hasPermission
    `;
    
    const result = await this.client.runQuery(query, { userId, resourceId, permission });
    return result.records[0].get('hasPermission');
  }
}
```
